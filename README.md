#PHP MVC Template
#Version 1.0

This is a little MVC template.
Basic but usable for learning MVC design pattern or little websites.

What's in ?

- "core" repository : containing global Model class, global Controller class and global configuration of the app. Model.php and Controller.php contains only basics methods. You can create others to adapt to your project.
- "models" repo : it contains the Model classes (in the example : Animes)
- "controllers" repo : containing the main controller "Index.php" with only 2 actions. You can create the others actions to have a full CRUD.
- "views" repo : wich contains repos corresponding to the controllers and files corresponding to the controllers actions. And a default layout.

The core repo, .htaccess and index.php (first one, wich is the bootstrap file) are good for a basic app.

The example is working with a basic database : "myanimes" ; table : "ANIMES" ; columns : "ID", "title", "rate", "tags", "description".
You can get these informations on the Animes.php (model). Import the animes.sql file on your database.
